# Handwritten Digit Classification 
Deep learning and neural networks play a vital role in image recognition, automatic text generation, and even self-driving cars. To begin working in these areas, you need to begin with a simple and manageable dataset like MNIST dataset. It is difficult to work with image data over flat relational data and as a beginner we suggest you can pick up and solve the MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Challenge. MNIST dataset is too small to fit into your PC memory and beginner-friendly. However, the handwritten digit recognition will challenge you.
