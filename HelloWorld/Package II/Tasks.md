7. Write a Python program to print the number of prime numbers which are less than or equal to an given integer.

n (1 = n = 999,999)
Input the number(n):
35
Number of prime numbers which are less than or equal to n.: 11

8. Write a Python program which reads a text (only alphabetical characters and spaces.) and prints two words. The first one is the word which is arise most frequently in the text. The second one is the word which has the maximum number of letters. 

9. Write a Python program to compute the sum of first n given prime numbers.
